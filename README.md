# Pokedex
Personal project to develop skills with the consumption of API's (in this case the PokeAPI), and with front-end using HTML, CSS and JS.
It consists of a Pokedex where we can enter the name or ID of the Pokemon, and with that it is possible to see its name, its image and its respective evolutions.
